I want you to turn this project into a TypeForm Clone. It should have the following features:

1. It should allow authenticated users to create new forms
2. It should allow the users who created a form to edit and delete the form
3. It should allow the users who created a form to view the results of the form inputs in a table view, it doesn't have to be built into the app it can use a CMS, it's up to you to make the best decision on this.
4. It should have a beatiful UX / UI
5. The form UX should match TypeForm as closely as possible, with the style of form etc...
6. When creating a form, the user should be able to configure the design to some extent, nothing crazy though as to make it not too complex.
